ZemiCompiler is a compiler for my programming language called Zemi, it is written in C++20.




The sole purpose of this compiler is to learn more things about AOT compilers
and code optimization, and Assembly as well.





I use Clang(clang++) as my C++ compiler, GCC should work as well but I don't test it because it tends to be buggy sometimes.





This project started recently, and I'm kinda slow to learn new things, so don't expect a fully working compiler anytime soon, but I'll finish it for sure, just be patient.





Note : This compiler is made ONLY for Linux, I don't plan to add support for Windows or macOS, but you're free to do so.
(The only part I won't do is the linker, too much work...)



Note : Build instructions not here yet.
